"Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, using carbon dioxide and water, while releasing oxygen as a byproduct."
"Photosynthesis: plants, algae, and some bacteria converting light energy into chemical energy (glucose), using carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen."
"Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy (glucose) in plants, algae, and some bacteria, while releasing oxygen as a byproduct."
"Green plants, algae, and certain bacteria perform photosynthesis, converting light energy into chemical energy (glucose) using carbon dioxide and water, and releasing oxygen."
"Photosynthesis is a process by which phototrophs convert light energy into chemical energy, which is later used to fuel cellular activities. The chemical energy is stored in the form of sugars, which are created from water and carbon dioxide."
